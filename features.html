  <h1 class="feature" >1. Submit and Receive OPPORTUNITIES meant for you!</h1>
  <p class="answer" style="width:100%">
    &emsp; Just text <b> 'submit'</b> to +18447002833 to begin the process of submitting an oppurtunity to my database. You will have the option to submit images or text directly to me and then give additional information about the oppurtunity through a google form the chatbot will send to you. These opportunites are directly sent to a database that will be further manually reviewed by HUB Coordinators to verify the opportunity, and then once approved the oppurtunity can be sent to other users! They'll be notified who submitted the opportunity if you choose to submit your name attached to your phone number through the use profile google form. 
    <br><br>&emsp; Text <b> 'user profile'</b> to begin creating a user profile where information about you will be used to calculate which opportunity is best for you. Currently we recommend opportunites based on your major, types of opportunity you indicated you liked, and when the oppurtunity will take place or is due. Additionally, in your user profile you have the option to decide when you would want to receive opporuntuies recommended for you (Daily, Weekly, or BiWeekly) and whether you would like to receive Company Blasts. These blasts will once be sent to you on the time basis you indicated (Daily, Weekly, or BiWeekly) to ensure you will not be spammed.
    <br><br> Check out the CEA Drive for engagements with companies, our HUB Coordinators will input these engagements into the database of opportunities.

  <h1 class="feature">2. Gain points towards winning a bookstore voucher by Submitting OPPORTUNITIES</h1>
  <p class="answer" style="width:100%">&emsp; The more high quality opportunies you submit, the more points you will receive where 1 point is for a single high quality opporunity.
